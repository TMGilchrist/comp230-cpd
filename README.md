# Weekly Reports

## Week 1
I find myself singularly uninspired regarding the world pitches. I have given little thought to the creation of a world, though I count that fault mine own, for the assignment is by all accounts a most interesting and fun idea. I think also, that while I enjoy the trappings of creation, I lack perhaps the vision to fully capture a setting. For this reason, what I wrought was less than perfect, and marred by a lack of practice in delivering the pitch.
Regardless, I have found meeting the new team for this year a most profitable venture, and one which I greatly enjoyed. Although discussion was obviously a little slow at first, we have managed to distill a few ideas amongst each other, which I believe to be exceptionally healthy for a young team.

## Week 2
After much deliberation, we have selected the first prototype on which to commence construction. From the skeletal remains of scavenged Unity Projects and example scripts, we have formed a most pleasing – to mine eyes at least – prototype of a cephalopod-centered climbing game. In addition, we have been introduced to other areas of study including dialogues by a Mr. Bohm, who – while clearly a keen student of etymology – could (I dare to venture) benefit from a study of the concise transfer of information.

## Week 3
The third week. Three is an auspicious number for many peoples. For my team however, our third week was that of our second prototype, which was beset by troubles. An ambitious project from the start, I believe my fellow programmer and I dallied too long making original code whilst the most intriguing and marvellous of the proposed features lay – not in the underlying artificery of base mechanisms – but in the unique and diverse potential of combat. Therefore, caught as we were in making basic features from naught (instead of more wisely finding an example upon which we could carve our mark) our finished product was less than could be desired.

## Week 4
I find the relief of discarding my thoughts of each week upon the page a sweet sensation; it is a fine practice and one that I can recommend to my colleagues at home. While one of our designers presented a prototype of the third concept quite by themselves, there is now a greater problem to contemplate. The matter of which prototype to choose is quickly becoming a heated topic, with proponents mostly split between the first and second. It is a worrying state to be in – one of transience – for I am unsure on what to work regarding this game. I cannot dedicate myself to improving any of the games while it is undecided and so I languish in this cell of indecision.

## Week 5
After much deliberation and near argument, our team reached a tenuous consensus as to which prototype to take forward unto full production. And thus, the octopus game shall become the focus of our team. It was a weight of my weary soul to have at last a single goal to focus on, for the uncertainty of our project was a tiresome burden. 

## Week 6
Our team meetings, while successful, are wracked I feel, by a certain mismatch of information, understanding and will. Many of my compatriots have not had the same wisdom of the Agile method imparted upon them, and thus there has been some confusion over the organisation of a scrum board. I must confess a lack of diligence on my part, in failing to more actively promote a more correct – at least to my understanding – practice of the Agile method.

## Week 7
Seven, a number of divine significance in many Abrahamic faiths and others besides. Despite this, I find this seventh week to be one of little excitement. We continue onwards with the game project, finding our footing as the team acquaints with one another a little better. Though our work is still somewhat sporadic and many of the team are not yet fully comfortable with the use of version control, I am confident that as we continue to work together, the workflow of the project will smooth.

## Week 8
Research on the topic of violence and video games – a most controversial topic as I have found – has been surprisingly interesting, though I must admit, I tired of writing such dry matter. On the other hand, I have greatly enjoyed the work on the 220th computing module, wherein I have been constructing a small graphical demo. Although the visuals of mine accomplishment are but basic, I am pleased in full with the code beneath. The work on the other project however, is less successful so far. Although I am confident in my ability to integrate the VR project with the VR headset, I have not yet attempted this, and I would be more comfortable doing it sooner rather than later. To this end I shall endeavour, nay, shall strive beyond all hindrance until I have accomplished this.

## Week 9
Week nine. Nine. A good number, the Eddas tell us. Nine long nights hung the True-Guesser from a windy tree, pierced with a spear, dedicated by himself to himself. This and an eye to take up knowledge and wisdom. What do we do for the same?

## Week 10
Although some few of our team have been mostly absent, the majority of the team have come together on this project most admirably in the last few weeks. I am full pleased by our progress, although I harbour some concern over the final direction of the game. There is indecision amongst our designers over the true nature of it. To be fully committed to puzzles and the design work that entails, or to embrace the art of the Speedrun and tailor the game thusly?  

Despite my misgivings I am feeling most hopeful. I do still have significant work in other areas that clutches at the purse-strings of my time and it is only fair and true to say that I have been somewhat remiss in these others projects, having become so enthused by the team game.

## Week 11
I have dedicated much of my time in this penultimate week to the work of the 210th computing module. Although my VR project lacks many of the more complex features I originally planned to implement, I am satisfied overall with what I have. It was a new and unknown area of study for myself, and working with the hardware necessary has been a significant challenge, yet also most enjoyable. 

## Week 12
The final week in which I have mostly done what polishing to my projects is possible before the long dark of winter. I am mostly happy with the work I have done so far, although I appreciate that I can greatly improve upon almost all of it. My essay writing in particular has left much to be desired, along with the management of my time between multiple projects. I am tired. I leave you with this stanza, less relevant than the last perhaps. But necessary, in its way. I would not disregard it, were I you.

Weary loom the endless stars,  
That hang from branches in the dark,  
While ice-thin winds scream from afar,  
And starlight bleeds down riven bark
